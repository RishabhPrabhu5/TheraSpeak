## Overview
TheraSpeak is an AI-powered web application designed to enhance mental health support by assisting both individuals in crisis and suicide hotline responders. Using reinforcement learning, the system provides real-time AI-driven suggestions for hotline workers while also offering automated counseling via SMS and voice calls. 

## Features
- **AI-Assisted Hotline Support:** Provides real-time AI-driven suggestions to hotline workers to improve their conversations with callers.
- **Live Transcription & AI Suggestions:** Uses OpenAIâ€™s API to transcribe calls and generate response recommendations.
- **Automated SMS Counseling:** Offers fast, AI-based mental health support via SMS, ensuring immediate assistance when human responders are unavailable.
- **Anonymity & Privacy:** Maintains the anonymity of both the caller and the hotline worker, ensuring a secure communication environment.
